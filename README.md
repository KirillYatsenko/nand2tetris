Nand to tetris course projects

Course home page: https://www.nand2tetris.org/

The elementary logic gate Nand (or its close relative Nor) is the fundamental building block
from which all hardware platforms are made. In this course we start from the humble Nand
gate and work our way through the construction of a modern computer system hardware
and software capable of running Tetris and any other program. In the process, we will
learn how computers work, how they are constructed, and how to plan and execute large
scale systems building projects.
